##### This project is part of the DSA Data Analysis Capstone, where I was tasked with performing an in-depth analysis of Amazon product data. The goal was        to uncover insights from customer reviews and product listings to inform decisions around pricing, marketing, and product improvement.I used Excel to       clean the dataset, create calculated columns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and design an interactive dashboard.
