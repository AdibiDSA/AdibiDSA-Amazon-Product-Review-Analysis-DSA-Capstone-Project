# Amazon Product Review Analysis – DSA Capstone Project
## Project Overview
##### This project is part of the DSA Data Analysis Capstone, where I was tasked with performing an in-depth analysis of Amazon product data. The goal was        to uncover insights from customer reviews and product listings to inform decisions around pricing, marketing, and product improvement.I used Excel to       clean the dataset, create calculated columns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and design an interactive dashboard.     
## Dataset Description
##### The dataset contains 1,465 rows and 16 columns of Web- scraped Amazon product review data, including:
      - Product Name
      - Product Category
      - Actual Price 
      - Discounted Price
      - Rating
      - Discount Percentage
      - Rating Count
      - Price Bucket Range (derived)
      - Discount Level (Derived)
      - Potential Revenue (derived)
      - Product ID
      - Discount percentage Band (derived)
      - Combined Score (derived)
      - Low Review (derived)

## Key Analysis Performed
      - Average discount percentage by product category
      - Product count and total reviews by category
      - Highest rated and most-reviewed products
      - Comparison of actual vs discounted prices
      - Price bucket segmentation and product distribution
      - Total potential revenue (Actual Price × Rating Count)
      - Relationship between discounts and ratings
      - Identification of top-performing products (rating × reviews)

## Tools Used
     - Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Calculated Columns, Dashboard Design)
     - Basic Formulas (e.g., IF, IFS, COUNTIF, AVERAGE, SUMPRODUCT, MAX)
