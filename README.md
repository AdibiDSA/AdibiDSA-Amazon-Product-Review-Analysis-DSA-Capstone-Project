#  Amazon Product Review Analysis – DSA Capstone Project

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **DSA Data Analysis Capstone**, where I was tasked with performing an in-depth analysis of Amazon product data.  
The goal was to uncover insights from customer reviews and product listings to inform decisions around pricing, marketing, and product improvement.  
I used **Microsoft Excel** to clean the dataset, create calculated columns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and design an interactive dashboard.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains **1,465 rows and 16 columns** of web-scraped Amazon product review data, including:

- Product Name  
- Product Category  
- Actual Price  
- Discounted Price  
- Rating  
- Discount Percentage  
- Rating Count  
- Price Bucket Range *(derived)*  
- Discount Level *(derived)*  
- Potential Revenue *(derived)*  
- Product ID  
- Discount Percentage Band *(derived)*  
- Combined Score *(derived)*  
- Low Review Indicator *(derived)*

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Average discount percentage by product category  
- Product count and total reviews by category  
- Highest rated and most-reviewed products  
- Comparison of actual vs discounted prices  
- Price bucket segmentation and product distribution  
- Total potential revenue (Actual Price × Rating Count)  
- Relationship between discounts and ratings  
- Identification of top-performing products (rating × reviews)

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Calculated Columns, Dashboard Design)  
- Basic Excel Formulas: `IF`, `IFS`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, `SUMPRODUCT`, `MAX`

  The ₹200–₹500 price range holds the majority of products, showing that affordability is a major factor influencing customer buying behavior on the platform.

- **Top Rated ≠ Most Discounted**  
  Products with the highest discounts are not necessarily the top-rated, highlighting that quality and value perception matter more to customers than just price cuts.

  A large number of products (over 1,300) have fewer than 1,000 reviews, pointing to potential underperformance or a need for better marketing and visibility strategies.
