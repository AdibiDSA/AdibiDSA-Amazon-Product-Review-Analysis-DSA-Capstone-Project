#  Amazon Product Review Analysis – DSA Capstone Project

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **DSA Data Analysis Capstone**, where I was tasked with performing an in-depth analysis of Amazon product data.  
The goal was to uncover insights from customer reviews and product listings to inform decisions around pricing, marketing, and product improvement.  
I used **Microsoft Excel** to clean the dataset, create calculated columns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and design an interactive dashboard.
